# Hi there, I'm Justin 👋

Hey there! I'm a computer science major graduating in December of 2024. I'm passionate about all realms of software development and I strive to reach the point where I can build any idea that comes to mind! I have a strong interest in web, mobile, and game development and would love to pursue a career in any of these fields. However, I'm also open to entry-level PM roles i.e project coordinator, associate project manager.

- 🔭 I'm currently working as a freelance developer/coding tutor as I pursue my CS degree. While I also focus on this startup I've co-founded. I'm also taking a project management course to eventually land my CPM certificate(Certified Associate in Project Management) - because I see a career in either project management, or development.
